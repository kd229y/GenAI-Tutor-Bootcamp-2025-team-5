| **Functionality**        | **50%**    | - The bot operates without errors and fulfills its intended purpose.                                                                                      |
|                          |            | - Accurate integration of RAG (e.g., demonstrates retrieval of relevant external data sources and effectively grounds responses).                          |
|                          |            | - Smooth interactions (clear responses, low latency, logical outputs).                                                                                    |
| **Innovation & Creativity** | **25%**    | - Unique or creative application of the bot for a specific subject or user group.                                                                         |
|                          |            | - Effective use of Gemini and embedding techniques to tailor the project.                                                                                 |
|                          |            | - Demonstrates originality in features or design.                                                                                                         |
| **Presentation Quality** | **25%**    | - Clear and structured presentation explaining the bot’s goals, design choices, and technical implementation.                                              |
|                          |            | - Demonstrates a solid understanding of RAG principles and embedding models.                                                                              |

### **Key Considerations**:
1. **Collaboration**: Each group member’s contribution should be visible. Teams will be asked to reflect on their collaboration in the presentation.
2. **Real-World Relevance**: Projects that address a real-world need or practical problem will be valued.
3. **Documentation**: Groups should submit basic documentation (e.g., README file or usage guide) for their bot.
